i was up in a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> over my <CONTENT> every now and then, but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> see nobody. i was at <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as i could get there. he <CONTENT>:
"why, my <CONTENT>, you are all out of <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> you <CONTENT> for your interest?"
"no, <CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>; "is there some for me?"
"<CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> is in, last <CONTENT>--over a hundred and fifty <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> for you. you had <CONTENT> <CONTENT> me <CONTENT> it along with your six <CONTENT>, because if you take it you'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> it."

i <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> about fifty <CONTENT>, and then i <CONTENT> on my <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> back to where my <CONTENT> was, a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> below the <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> in, and was off in a <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> up-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> enough to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> across. i <CONTENT> off the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, for i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> on then. when i was about the <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, so i <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>; the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> over the <CONTENT> but <CONTENT>--eleven. when i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> i never <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, though i was most <CONTENT>, but i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> into the <CONTENT> where my <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to be, and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> fire there on a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>.
then i <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> out for our <CONTENT>, a <CONTENT> and a <CONTENT> below, as <CONTENT> as i could go. i <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> through the <CONTENT> and up the <CONTENT> and into the <CONTENT>. there <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> him out and <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT> up and <CONTENT> yourself, <CONTENT>! there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. they're after us!"
<CONTENT> never <CONTENT> no <CONTENT>, he never <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>; but the <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> for the next <CONTENT> an <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about how he was <CONTENT>. by that <CONTENT> everything we had in the <CONTENT> was on our <CONTENT>, and she was <CONTENT> to be <CONTENT> out from the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> where she was <CONTENT>. we put out the <CONTENT> fire at the <CONTENT> the first <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> show a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> after that.
i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> out from the <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>; but if there was a <CONTENT> around i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> see it, for <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to see by. then we <CONTENT> out the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> along down in the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> still--never <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>.
it must a been <CONTENT> on to one <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> when we <CONTENT> below the <CONTENT> at last, and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> seem to go <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. if a <CONTENT> was to <CONTENT> along we was <CONTENT> to take to the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and it was well a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, for we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever <CONTENT> to put the <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>, or a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, or anything to <CONTENT>. we was in <CONTENT> too much of a <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> of so many <CONTENT>. it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to put everything on the <CONTENT>.
if the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> they found the <CONTENT> fire i <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> it all <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>, they <CONTENT> <CONTENT> from us, and if my <CONTENT> the fire never <CONTENT> them it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> of mine. i <CONTENT> it as <CONTENT> down on them as i could.
when the first <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to show we <CONTENT> up to a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT> side, and <CONTENT> off <CONTENT> <CONTENT> with the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> with them so she <CONTENT> <CONTENT> there had been a <CONTENT>-in in the <CONTENT> there. a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> is a <CONTENT> that has <CONTENT> on it as thick as <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>.
we had <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT> side, and the <CONTENT> was down the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> at that <CONTENT>, so we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> across us. we <CONTENT> there all <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and up-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> all about the <CONTENT> i had <CONTENT> with that <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she was a <CONTENT> one, and if she was to <CONTENT> after us herself she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> down and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> fire--no, <CONTENT>, she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>. well, then, i <CONTENT>, why <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> she <CONTENT> her <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>? <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> she <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of it by the <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and he <CONTENT> they must a <CONTENT> up-<CONTENT> to get a <CONTENT> and so they <CONTENT> all that <CONTENT>, or else we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be here on a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> or <CONTENT> <CONTENT> below the <CONTENT>--no, <CONTENT>, we would be in that same <CONTENT> <CONTENT> again. so i <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> what was the <CONTENT> they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get us as <CONTENT> as they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>.
when it was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> on <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> our <CONTENT> out of the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up and down and across; nothing in <CONTENT>; so <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up some of the top <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to get under in <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and to keep the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> made a <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> it a <CONTENT> or more above the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>, so now the <CONTENT> and all the <CONTENT> was out of <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> we made a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> about five or six <CONTENT> <CONTENT> with a <CONTENT> around it for to <CONTENT> it to its <CONTENT>; this was to <CONTENT> a fire on in <CONTENT> <CONTENT> or <CONTENT>; the <CONTENT> would keep it from being <CONTENT>. we made an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, too, because one of the others might get <CONTENT> on a <CONTENT> or something. we <CONTENT> up a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on, because we must always <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> whenever we see a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> down-<CONTENT>, to keep from <CONTENT> <CONTENT> over; but we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> have to <CONTENT> it for up-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> we see we was in what they call a "<CONTENT>"; for the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> yet, very <CONTENT> <CONTENT> being still a <CONTENT> under <CONTENT>; so up-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> always <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>.
this <CONTENT> <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> between <CONTENT> and eight <CONTENT>, with a <CONTENT> that was <CONTENT> over four <CONTENT> an <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> now and then to keep off <CONTENT>. it was <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT>, still <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> on our <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up at the <CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> often that we <CONTENT>--only a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. we had <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> as a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and nothing ever <CONTENT> to us at all--that <CONTENT>, nor the next, nor the next.
every <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, some of them <CONTENT> up on <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, nothing but <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>; not a <CONTENT> could you see. the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>, and it was <CONTENT> the whole <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up. in <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> they <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> there was twenty or <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>, but i never <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> i see that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> at two <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> that still <CONTENT>. there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> there; <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>.
every <CONTENT> now i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> towards ten <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> at some <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> ten or fifteen <CONTENT>' <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> or <CONTENT> or other <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>; and sometimes i <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> him along. <CONTENT> always <CONTENT>, take a <CONTENT> when you get a <CONTENT>, because if you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> him yourself you can <CONTENT> find <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>, and a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever <CONTENT>. i never see <CONTENT> when he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> himself, but that is what he <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, anyway.
<CONTENT> before <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> into <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, or a <CONTENT>, or a <CONTENT>, or some <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, or <CONTENT> of that <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> always <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> if you was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> them back some <CONTENT>; but the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> anything but a <CONTENT> name for <CONTENT>, and no <CONTENT> <CONTENT> would do it. <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> would be for us to <CONTENT> out two or three <CONTENT> from the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them any more--then he <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the others. so we <CONTENT> it over all one <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> along down the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> up our <CONTENT> whether to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, or the <CONTENT>, or the <CONTENT>, or what. but towards <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> it all <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>. we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> before that, but it was all <CONTENT> now. i was <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> out, too, because <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be <CONTENT> for two or three <CONTENT> yet.

"well, then, i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you. but <CONTENT> me only <CONTENT> this one more--now <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you have it in your <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it?"
the <CONTENT> never <CONTENT> nothing for a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; then he <CONTENT>:

"i <CONTENT> i never <CONTENT> if i done it, <CONTENT>, and that'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>' to do it, because i was; but you--i <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> in <CONTENT> <CONTENT>' me."
"it'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>! you done it, and you <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> you done it, or--"
the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and then he <CONTENT> out:
"'<CONTENT>!--i own up!"
i was very <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> that; it made me <CONTENT> much more <CONTENT> than what i was <CONTENT> before. so the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> off and <CONTENT>:
"if you ever <CONTENT> it again i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you. it'<CONTENT> well for you to <CONTENT> there and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>--it'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for you, after the <CONTENT> you'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. i never see such an <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> everything--and i a-<CONTENT> you all the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> you was my own <CONTENT>. you <CONTENT> to been <CONTENT> of yourself to <CONTENT> by and <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> on to a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and you never <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> for '<CONTENT>. it <CONTENT> me <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> i was <CONTENT> enough to <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> you, i can see now why you was so <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT>--you <CONTENT> to get what <CONTENT> i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> out of the <CONTENT> and one <CONTENT> or another, and <CONTENT> it all!"
the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, and still a-<CONTENT>:
"why, <CONTENT>, it was you that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT>; it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> me."
"<CONTENT> up! i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> no more out of you!" <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>. "and now you see what you <CONTENT> by it. they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> all their own <CONTENT> back, and all of <CONTENT> but a <CONTENT> or two besides. <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> me no more <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> you <CONTENT>!"
so the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> into the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to his <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>, and before <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> his <CONTENT>; and so in about a <CONTENT> an <CONTENT> they was as thick as <CONTENT> again, and the <CONTENT> they <CONTENT>, the <CONTENT> they <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> off a-<CONTENT> in each other'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. they both <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get <CONTENT> enough to <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> to not <CONTENT> about <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> again. that made me <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. of <CONTENT> when they <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> we had a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> everything.
we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> again at any <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>; <CONTENT> <CONTENT> along down the <CONTENT>. we was down <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> now, and a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> from <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> with <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on them, <CONTENT> down from the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. it was the first i ever see it <CONTENT>, and it made the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. so now the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> they was out of <CONTENT>, and they <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> again.
first they done a <CONTENT> on <CONTENT>; but they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> enough for them both to get <CONTENT> on. then in another <CONTENT> they <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>; but they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no more how to <CONTENT> than a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so the first <CONTENT> they made the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in and <CONTENT> them out of <CONTENT>. another <CONTENT> they <CONTENT> to go at <CONTENT>; but they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up and give them a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and made them <CONTENT> out. they <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and a <CONTENT> of everything; but they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> seem to have no <CONTENT>. so at last they <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> around the <CONTENT> as she <CONTENT> along, <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and never <CONTENT> nothing, by the <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> at a <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>.
and at last they <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> their <CONTENT> together in the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> two or three <CONTENT> at a <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> and me <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of it. we <CONTENT> they was <CONTENT> up some <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> than ever. we <CONTENT> it over and over, and at last we made up our <CONTENT> they was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> into <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> or <CONTENT>, or was <CONTENT> into the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, or something. so then we was <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and made up an <CONTENT> that we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> have nothing in the <CONTENT> to do with such <CONTENT>, and if we ever <CONTENT> the least show we would give them the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> out and <CONTENT> them behind. well, <CONTENT> one <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> in a <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about two <CONTENT> below a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> us all to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> up to <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> around to see if <CONTENT> had <CONTENT> any <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> there yet. ("<CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, you <CONTENT>," <CONTENT> i to myself; "and when you get through <CONTENT> it you'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> back here and <CONTENT> what has become of me and <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT>--and you'<CONTENT> have to take it out in <CONTENT>.") and he <CONTENT> if he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> back by <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and me would <CONTENT> it was all <CONTENT>, and we was to <CONTENT> along.
so we <CONTENT> where we was. the <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> around, and was in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. he <CONTENT> us for everything, and we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> seem to do nothing <CONTENT>; he found <CONTENT> with every <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. something was a-<CONTENT>, <CONTENT>. i was <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> when <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and no <CONTENT>; we could have a <CONTENT>, anyway--and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT> on top of it. so me and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up to the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> around there for the <CONTENT>, and by-and-by we found him in the back <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, very <CONTENT>, and a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> him for <CONTENT>, and he a-<CONTENT> and a-<CONTENT> with all his might, and so <CONTENT> he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> do nothing to them. the <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> him for an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> back, and the <CONTENT> they was <CONTENT> at it i <CONTENT> out and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> out of my <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, for i see our <CONTENT>; and i made up my <CONTENT> that it would be a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> before they ever see me and <CONTENT> again. i <CONTENT> down there all out of <CONTENT> but <CONTENT> up with <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> out:

once i <CONTENT> to myself it would be a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> to be a <CONTENT> at <CONTENT> where his <CONTENT> was, as <CONTENT> as he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to be a <CONTENT>, and so i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> him to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> where he was. but i <CONTENT> give up that <CONTENT> for two <CONTENT>: she'<CONTENT> be <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> at his <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> her, and so she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT> again; and if she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it all the <CONTENT>, and so he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. and then <CONTENT> of me! it would get all around that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> to get his <CONTENT>; and if i was ever to see <CONTENT> from that <CONTENT> again i'<CONTENT> be <CONTENT> to get down and <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>. that'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>: a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-down <CONTENT>, and then he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to take no <CONTENT> of it. <CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as he can <CONTENT> it, it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT>. that was my <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. the more i <CONTENT> about this, the more my <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> me, and the more <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>-down and <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. and at last, when it <CONTENT> me all of a <CONTENT> that here was the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> me in the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> me <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> was being <CONTENT> all the <CONTENT> from up there in <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> i was <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever done me no <CONTENT>, and now was <CONTENT> me there'<CONTENT> one that'<CONTENT> always on the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> to <CONTENT> no such <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to go only <CONTENT> so <CONTENT> and no further, i most <CONTENT> in my <CONTENT> i was so <CONTENT>. well, i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> i could to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it up somehow for myself by <CONTENT> i was <CONTENT> up <CONTENT>, and so i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> so much to <CONTENT>; but something <CONTENT> of me <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, "there was the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, you could a <CONTENT> to it; and if you'<CONTENT> a done it they'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> you there that <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> as i'<CONTENT> been <CONTENT> about that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> fire."
it made me <CONTENT>. and i about made up my <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and see if i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> being the <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> i was and be <CONTENT>. so i <CONTENT> down. but the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. why <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> they? it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it from him. nor from me, neither. i <CONTENT> very well why they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. it was because my <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; it was because i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; it was because i was <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. i was <CONTENT> on to give up <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of me i was <CONTENT> on to the <CONTENT> one of all. i was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i would do the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and go and <CONTENT> to that <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> where he was; but <CONTENT> down in me i <CONTENT> it was a <CONTENT>, and he <CONTENT> it. you can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>--i found that out.
so i was full of <CONTENT>, full as i could be; and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> what to do. at last i had an <CONTENT>; and i <CONTENT>, i'<CONTENT> go and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>--and then see if i can <CONTENT>. why, it was <CONTENT>, the <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> off, and my <CONTENT> all <CONTENT>. so i <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> and a <CONTENT>, all <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> down and <CONTENT>:
<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, your <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> is down here two <CONTENT> below <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> has <CONTENT> him and he will give him up for the <CONTENT> if you <CONTENT>.
<CONTENT> <CONTENT>.
i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and all <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> for the first <CONTENT> i had ever <CONTENT> so in my <CONTENT>, and i <CONTENT> i could <CONTENT> now. but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> do it <CONTENT> off, but <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> down and <CONTENT> there <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> how <CONTENT> it was all this <CONTENT> so, and how <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> to being <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. and <CONTENT> on <CONTENT>. and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> over our <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT>; and i see <CONTENT> before me all the <CONTENT>: in the <CONTENT> and in the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, sometimes <CONTENT>, sometimes <CONTENT>, and we a-<CONTENT> along, <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. but somehow i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> seem to <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> me against him, but only the other <CONTENT>. i'<CONTENT> see him <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> on top of his'<CONTENT>, '<CONTENT> of <CONTENT> me, so i could go on <CONTENT>; and see him how <CONTENT> he was when i <CONTENT> back out of the <CONTENT>; and when i <CONTENT> to him again in the <CONTENT>, up there where the <CONTENT> was; and such-<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and would always call me <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> me and do everything he could <CONTENT> of for me, and how <CONTENT> he always was; and at last i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> him by <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> we had <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and he was so <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> i was the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> ever had in the <CONTENT>, and the only one he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> now; and then i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> around and see that <CONTENT>.
it was a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> it up, and <CONTENT> it in my <CONTENT>. i was a-<CONTENT>, because i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> two <CONTENT>, and i <CONTENT> it. i <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> to myself:
"all <CONTENT>, then, i'<CONTENT> go to <CONTENT>"--and <CONTENT> it up.
it was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but they was <CONTENT>. and i <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and never <CONTENT> no more about <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> the whole <CONTENT> out of my <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> i would take up <CONTENT> again, which was in my <CONTENT>, being <CONTENT> up to it, and the other <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>. and for a <CONTENT> i would go to <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out of <CONTENT> again; and if i could <CONTENT> up anything <CONTENT>, i would do that, too; because as <CONTENT> as i was in, and in for <CONTENT>, i might as well go the whole <CONTENT>.
then i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> over how to get at it, and <CONTENT> over some <CONTENT> many <CONTENT> in my <CONTENT>; and at last <CONTENT> up a <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> me. so then i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that was down the <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, and as <CONTENT> as it was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> out with my <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for it, and <CONTENT> it there, and then <CONTENT> in. i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> through, and <CONTENT> up before it was <CONTENT>, and had my <CONTENT>, and put on my <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up some others and one <CONTENT> or another in a <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> below where i <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> with <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> into her and <CONTENT> her where i could find her again when i <CONTENT> her, about a <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> below a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that was on the <CONTENT>.
then i <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT>, and when i <CONTENT> the mill i see a <CONTENT> on it, "<CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>," and when i <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, two or three hundred <CONTENT> further along, i <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> see nobody around, though it was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> now. but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, because i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to see nobody <CONTENT> yet--i only <CONTENT> to get the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> to my <CONTENT>, i was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> up there from the <CONTENT>, not from below. so i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> along, <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>. well, the very first <CONTENT> i see when i <CONTENT> there was the <CONTENT>. he was <CONTENT> up a bill for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--three-<CONTENT> <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> that other <CONTENT>. they had the <CONTENT>, them <CONTENT>! i was <CONTENT> on him before i could <CONTENT>. he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT>-<CONTENT>! where'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> from?" then he <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, "where'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>?--<CONTENT> her in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>?"
i <CONTENT>:
"why, that'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> what i was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> your <CONTENT>."
then he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> so <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>:
"what was your <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> me?" he <CONTENT>.
"well," i <CONTENT>, "when i see the <CONTENT> in that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> to myself, we can'<CONTENT> get him <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so i <CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> around <CONTENT> to put in the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. a <CONTENT> up and <CONTENT> me ten <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> over the <CONTENT> and back to <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, and so i <CONTENT> along; but when we was <CONTENT> him to the <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> me a-<CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> behind him to <CONTENT> him along, he was too <CONTENT> for me and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and we after him. we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> have no <CONTENT>, and so we had to <CONTENT> him all over the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> him out. we never <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; then we <CONTENT> him over, and i <CONTENT> down for the <CONTENT>. when i <CONTENT> there and see it was <CONTENT>, i <CONTENT> to myself, 'they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> into <CONTENT> and had to <CONTENT>; and they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>, which is the only <CONTENT> i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>, and now i'<CONTENT> in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> no more, nor nothing, and no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>;' so i <CONTENT> down and <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> all <CONTENT>. but what <CONTENT> become of the <CONTENT>, then?--and <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> <CONTENT>!"
"<CONTENT> if i <CONTENT>--that is, what'<CONTENT> become of the <CONTENT>. that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> had made a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> forty <CONTENT>, and when we found him in the <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> had <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> with him and <CONTENT> every <CONTENT> but what he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>; and when i <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> <CONTENT> last <CONTENT> and found the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, we <CONTENT>, 'that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> has <CONTENT> our <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> us, and <CONTENT> off down the <CONTENT>.'"
"i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>, would i?--the only <CONTENT> i had in the <CONTENT>, and the only <CONTENT>."
"we never <CONTENT> of that. <CONTENT> is, i <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> him our <CONTENT>; <CONTENT>, we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> him so--<CONTENT> <CONTENT> we had <CONTENT> enough for him. so when we see the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> and we <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> anything for it but to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> another <CONTENT>. and i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> along ever since, <CONTENT> as a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>. where'<CONTENT> that ten <CONTENT>? give it here."
i had <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, so i give him ten <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT> him to <CONTENT> it for something to <CONTENT>, and give me some, because it was all the <CONTENT> i had, and i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> had nothing to <CONTENT> since <CONTENT>. he never <CONTENT> nothing. the next <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> on me and <CONTENT>:
"do you <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> would <CONTENT> on us? we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> him if he done that!"
"how can he <CONTENT>? <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> he <CONTENT> off?"
"no! that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> him, and never <CONTENT> with me, and the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
"<CONTENT> him?" i <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> to cry; "why, he was my <CONTENT>, and that was my <CONTENT>. where is he?--i <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>."
"well, you can'<CONTENT> get your <CONTENT>, that'<CONTENT> all--so <CONTENT> up your <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> here--do you <CONTENT> you'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> on us? <CONTENT> if i <CONTENT> i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you. why, if you was to <CONTENT> on us--"
he <CONTENT>, but i never see the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> so <CONTENT> out of his <CONTENT> before. i <CONTENT> on a-<CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>:
"i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> on nobody; and i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> out and find my <CONTENT>."
he <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> there with his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on his <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up his <CONTENT>. at last he <CONTENT>:
"i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you something. we <CONTENT> to be here three <CONTENT>. if you'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you where to find him."
so i <CONTENT>, and he <CONTENT>:
"a <CONTENT> by the name of <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--" and then he <CONTENT>. you see, he <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> me the <CONTENT>; but when he <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> again, i <CONTENT> he was <CONTENT> his <CONTENT>. and so he was. he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> me; he <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> me out of the <CONTENT> the whole three <CONTENT>. so <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT>:
"the <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> him is <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>--and he <CONTENT> forty <CONTENT> back here in the <CONTENT>, on the <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>."
"all <CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>, "i can <CONTENT> it in three <CONTENT>. and i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> this very <CONTENT>."
"no you <CONTENT>, you'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> now; and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> any <CONTENT> about it, neither, nor do any <CONTENT> by the <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> keep a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in your <CONTENT> and move <CONTENT> along, and then you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get into <CONTENT> with us, <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>?"
that was the <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>, and that was the one i <CONTENT> for. i <CONTENT> to be <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>.
"so <CONTENT> out," he <CONTENT>; "and you can <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> whatever you <CONTENT> to. <CONTENT> you can get him to <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> is your <CONTENT>--some <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> there'<CONTENT> such down <CONTENT> here. and when you <CONTENT> him the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you when you <CONTENT> to him what the <CONTENT> was for <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> out. go '<CONTENT> now, and <CONTENT> him anything you <CONTENT> to; but <CONTENT> you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> your <CONTENT> any between here and there."
so i <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> for the back <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> around, but i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he was <CONTENT> me. but i <CONTENT> i could <CONTENT> him out at that. i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out in the <CONTENT> as much as a <CONTENT> before i <CONTENT>; then i <CONTENT> back through the <CONTENT> towards <CONTENT>'. i <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in on my <CONTENT> <CONTENT> off without <CONTENT> around, because i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> these <CONTENT> could get <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> with their <CONTENT>. i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> all i <CONTENT> to of them, and <CONTENT> to get <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of them.

that'<CONTENT> all he <CONTENT>. he was the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i ever see. but it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; because he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> only <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, he was a <CONTENT>, too, and had a <CONTENT> one-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> down back of the <CONTENT>, which he <CONTENT> it himself at his own <CONTENT>, for a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and never <CONTENT> nothing for his <CONTENT>, and it was <CONTENT> it, too. there was <CONTENT> other <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> that, and done the same <CONTENT>, down <CONTENT>.
in about <CONTENT> an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up to the front <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she see it through the <CONTENT>, because it was only about fifty <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>:

<CONTENT> made a <CONTENT> for the front <CONTENT>, because, of <CONTENT>, a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> every <CONTENT>, and so he <CONTENT> over the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, for interest, when he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> was over the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>; the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>, and we was all <CONTENT> in the front <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> had his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on, and an <CONTENT>--and that was always <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. in them <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to him to <CONTENT> in an amount of <CONTENT> that was <CONTENT>. he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> along up that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>; no, he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>. when he <CONTENT> a-front of us he <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> ever so <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> it was the <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> that had <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in it and he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> them, and <CONTENT>:

"<CONTENT>, i can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you so much <CONTENT>; i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> of it. i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>--i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>."
"but we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you <CONTENT>--it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to do it. <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in."
"<CONTENT>, do," <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; "it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> to us, not a <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>. you must <CONTENT>. it'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> three <CONTENT>, and we can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you <CONTENT>. and, besides, i'<CONTENT> already <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> to put on another <CONTENT> when i see you <CONTENT>; so you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> us. <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in and <CONTENT> yourself at <CONTENT>."

"well," he <CONTENT>, "it <CONTENT> <CONTENT> me so. i can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> it out, somehow. they <CONTENT> you would, and i <CONTENT> you would. but--" he <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> around <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> he could <CONTENT> across a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up on the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, "<CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> me to <CONTENT> her, <CONTENT>?"
"why, no; i--i--well, no, i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>."
then he <CONTENT> on around the same <CONTENT> to me, and <CONTENT>:

he never <CONTENT> nothing. but he <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and then for a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> while i <CONTENT> that he was <CONTENT>. then he <CONTENT>:
"it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. if we was <CONTENT> it would, because then we'<CONTENT> have as many <CONTENT> as we <CONTENT>, and no <CONTENT>; and we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get but a few <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, every <CONTENT>, while they was <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and so our <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get <CONTENT>, and we could keep it up <CONTENT> along, <CONTENT> in and <CONTENT> out, and do it <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> to be done. but we can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> along; we <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>; we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. if we was to put in another <CONTENT> this <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> have to <CONTENT> off for a <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> our <CONTENT> get well--<CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> with them <CONTENT>."
"well, then, what we <CONTENT> to do, <CONTENT>?"

"well," he <CONTENT>, "there'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>-on in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> this; if it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> so, i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> of it, nor i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> by and see the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--because <CONTENT> is <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> is <CONTENT>, and a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> when he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. it might <CONTENT> for you to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out with a <CONTENT>, without any <CONTENT> on, because you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT>; but it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> for me, because i do <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>."
he had his own by him, but i <CONTENT> him mine. he <CONTENT> it down, and <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>."
i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> what to do--but then i <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> around amongst the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> and give it to him, and he <CONTENT> it and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and never <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>.
he was always <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>. full of <CONTENT>.
so then i <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, and then we <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> about, and made the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT> to it about a <CONTENT> an <CONTENT>, which was as <CONTENT> as we could <CONTENT> up; but we had a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> to show for it. when i <CONTENT> up <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> out at the <CONTENT> and see <CONTENT> <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> with the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, but he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> it, his <CONTENT> was so <CONTENT>. at last he <CONTENT>:
"it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT>, it can'<CONTENT> be done. what you <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> do? can'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> of no <CONTENT>?"
"<CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>, "but i <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> on it'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>."
so he done it.
next <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>, for to <CONTENT> some <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> out of, and six <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and i <CONTENT> around the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for a <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> three <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> enough; but i <CONTENT> nobody <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever see the <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out, because they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> under the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>--then we could <CONTENT> them back and he could <CONTENT> them over again. so <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>. then he <CONTENT>:
"now, the <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> out is, how to get the <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>."
"take them in through the <CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>, "when we get it done."
he only <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> something about nobody ever <CONTENT> of such an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and then he <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. by-and-by he <CONTENT> he had <CONTENT> out two or three <CONTENT>, but there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> on any of them yet. <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> first.
that <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> after ten, and <CONTENT> one of the <CONTENT> along, and <CONTENT> under the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so we <CONTENT> it in, and it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> him. then we <CONTENT> in with the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and in about two <CONTENT> and a <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> was done. we <CONTENT> in under <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> and into the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> around and found the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it, and <CONTENT> over <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and found him <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and then we <CONTENT> him up <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. he was so <CONTENT> to see us he most <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> us <CONTENT>, and all the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he could <CONTENT> of; and was for <CONTENT> us <CONTENT> up a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> off of his <CONTENT> with <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> out without <CONTENT> any <CONTENT>. but <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> him how <CONTENT> it would be, and <CONTENT> down and <CONTENT> him all about our <CONTENT>, and how we could <CONTENT> them in a <CONTENT> any <CONTENT> there was an <CONTENT>; and not to be the least <CONTENT>, because we would see he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>. so <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> it was all <CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT> there and <CONTENT> over <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>, and when <CONTENT> <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in every <CONTENT> or two to <CONTENT> with him, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in to see if he was <CONTENT> and had <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and both of them was <CONTENT> as they could be, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>:
"now i <CONTENT> how to <CONTENT> it. we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you some <CONTENT> by them."
i <CONTENT>, "<CONTENT>'<CONTENT> do nothing of the <CONTENT>; it'<CONTENT> one of the most <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i ever <CONTENT>;" but he never <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to me; <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on. it was his <CONTENT> when he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> <CONTENT>.

there was a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of them down <CONTENT>, and it <CONTENT> us a whole <CONTENT>, but we done the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. then we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> out our <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>; and here <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, with a <CONTENT> in one <CONTENT> and a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> in <CONTENT>'other, <CONTENT> as <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> as <CONTENT> before last. he <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> around, first to one <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> and then another, <CONTENT> he'<CONTENT> been to them all. then he <CONTENT> about five <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> off of his <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. then he <CONTENT> off <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> towards the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>:

and so he <CONTENT> on a-<CONTENT> up <CONTENT>, and then we <CONTENT>. he was a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. and always is.
<CONTENT> was a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about what to do for a <CONTENT>, but he <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to have it; so he <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>. when he had <CONTENT> it out he <CONTENT> me how we was to do; then we <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> around the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> we see <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> them out to one side, and i <CONTENT> one of them up my <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>:

"i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT>' <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> but nine!" she <CONTENT>. "why, what in the <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> take the <CONTENT>, i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> again."
so i <CONTENT> back the one i had, and when she <CONTENT> done <CONTENT>, she <CONTENT>:

"you <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you see me <CONTENT> '<CONTENT>?"
"i <CONTENT>, but--"
"well, i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> again."
so i <CONTENT> one, and they <CONTENT> out nine, same as the other <CONTENT>. well, she was in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> all over, she was so <CONTENT>. but she <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> for a <CONTENT> sometimes; and so, three <CONTENT> they <CONTENT> out <CONTENT>, and three <CONTENT> they <CONTENT> out <CONTENT>. then she <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it across the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>; and she <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> out and <CONTENT> her have some <CONTENT>, and if we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> around her again <CONTENT> that and <CONTENT> she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> us. so we had the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> it in her <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> she was a-<CONTENT> us our <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it all <CONTENT>, along with her <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, before <CONTENT>. we was very well <CONTENT> with this <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>, because he <CONTENT> now she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> again to <CONTENT> her <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> if she <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> that after she'<CONTENT> about <CONTENT> her <CONTENT> off for the next three <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> she'<CONTENT> give it up and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> her to ever <CONTENT> them any more.
so we put the <CONTENT> back on the <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> one out of her <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> on <CONTENT> it back and <CONTENT> it again for a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> how many <CONTENT> she had any more, and she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of her <CONTENT> out about it, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them again not to <CONTENT> her <CONTENT>; she <CONTENT> <CONTENT> first.
so we was all <CONTENT> now, as to the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT>, by the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT>-up <CONTENT>; and as to the <CONTENT>, it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT>, it would <CONTENT> over by-and-by.
but that <CONTENT> was a <CONTENT>; we had no <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> with that <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT> it up <CONTENT> down in the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> it there; and we <CONTENT> it done at last, and very <CONTENT>, too; but not all in one <CONTENT>; and we had to <CONTENT> up three <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> full of <CONTENT> before we <CONTENT> through, and we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> much all over, in <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> put out with the <CONTENT>; because, you see, we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> nothing but a <CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> it up <CONTENT>, and she would always <CONTENT> in. but of <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> at last--which was to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, too, in the <CONTENT>. so then we <CONTENT> in with <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> all in <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> them together, and <CONTENT> before <CONTENT> we had a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that you could a <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> with. we <CONTENT> on it <CONTENT> nine <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> it.

"that <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>. you <CONTENT> to do it with <CONTENT>."
"she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> on my <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, she <CONTENT> will; <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>' <CONTENT> ever cry."
so <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>. but he <CONTENT> it over, and then <CONTENT> <CONTENT> would have to <CONTENT> along the <CONTENT> he could with an <CONTENT>. he <CONTENT> he would go to the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> one, <CONTENT>, in <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, in the <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he would "<CONTENT>' '<CONTENT> <CONTENT> have <CONTENT> in his <CONTENT>;" and found so much <CONTENT> with it, and with the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, on top of all the other <CONTENT> he had to do on <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, which made it more <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to be a <CONTENT> than anything he ever <CONTENT>, that <CONTENT> most <CONTENT> all <CONTENT> with him; and <CONTENT> he was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> down with more <CONTENT> <CONTENT> than a <CONTENT> ever had in the <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> a name for himself, and yet he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> enough to <CONTENT> them, and they was <CONTENT> about <CONTENT> on him. so <CONTENT> he was <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> so no more, and then me and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>.
in the <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> up to the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it down, and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, and in about an <CONTENT> we had fifteen of the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>; and then we <CONTENT> it and put it in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> under <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. but while we was <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> found it there, and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of it to see if the <CONTENT> would <CONTENT> out, and they <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she <CONTENT> in, and when we <CONTENT> back she was a-<CONTENT> on top of the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> what they could to keep off the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for her. so she <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> us both with the <CONTENT>, and we was as much as two <CONTENT> <CONTENT> another fifteen or <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, because the first <CONTENT> was the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>. i never see a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> than what that first <CONTENT> was.
we <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and one <CONTENT> or another; and we <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>. the <CONTENT> was at <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> give it <CONTENT> up, but <CONTENT> with them as <CONTENT> as we could; because we <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them out or they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> us out, and they done it. then we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT>, and was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> all <CONTENT> again, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> down <CONTENT>. and so we <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, and put them in a <CONTENT>, and put it in our <CONTENT>, and by that <CONTENT> it was <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, and a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>: and <CONTENT>?--<CONTENT>, no, i <CONTENT> not! and there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up there when we <CONTENT> back--we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and they <CONTENT> out somehow, and <CONTENT>. but it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> much, because they was still on the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. so we <CONTENT> we could get some of them again. no, there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> about the <CONTENT> for a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. you'<CONTENT> see them <CONTENT> from the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> every now and then; and they <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in your <CONTENT>, or down the back of your <CONTENT>, and most of the <CONTENT> where you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them. well, they was <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> in a <CONTENT> of them; but that never made no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; she <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, be the <CONTENT> what they might, and she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them no <CONTENT> you could <CONTENT> it; and every <CONTENT> one of them <CONTENT> down on her, it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> what she was <CONTENT>, she would <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> down and <CONTENT> out. i never see such a <CONTENT>. and you could <CONTENT> her <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get her to take a-<CONTENT> of one of them with the <CONTENT>. and if she <CONTENT> over and found one in <CONTENT> she would <CONTENT> out and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> that you would <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>. she <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> so that he <CONTENT> he could most <CONTENT> there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever been no <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. why, after every last <CONTENT> had been <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out of the <CONTENT> for as much as a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> over it yet; she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> over it; when she was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about something you could <CONTENT> her on the back of her <CONTENT> with a <CONTENT> and she would <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out of her <CONTENT>. it was very <CONTENT>. but <CONTENT> <CONTENT> all <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> so. he <CONTENT> they was made that <CONTENT> for some <CONTENT> or other.
we <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> every <CONTENT> one of our <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in her <CONTENT>, and she <CONTENT> these <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> nothing to what she would do if we ever <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> again with them. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, because they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> amount to nothing; but i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> we had to <CONTENT> in another <CONTENT>. but we <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> in, and all the other <CONTENT>; and you never see a <CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> was when they'<CONTENT> all <CONTENT> out for <CONTENT> and go for him. <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and so they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for him, and <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for him. and he <CONTENT> that between the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT> there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> in <CONTENT> for him, <CONTENT>; and when there was, a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, it was so <CONTENT>, and it was always <CONTENT>, he <CONTENT>, because they never all <CONTENT> at one <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about, so when the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> was on <CONTENT>, and when the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on <CONTENT>, so he always had one <CONTENT> under him, in his <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'other <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> over him, and if he <CONTENT> up to <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> would take a <CONTENT> at him as he <CONTENT> over. he <CONTENT> if he ever <CONTENT> out this <CONTENT> he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever be a <CONTENT> again, not for a <CONTENT>.
well, by the <CONTENT> of three <CONTENT> everything was in <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> in <CONTENT>, in a <CONTENT>, and every <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he would get up and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> in his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>; the <CONTENT> was made, the <CONTENT> and so on was all <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT>; the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> was <CONTENT> in two, and we had <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT>, and it give us a most <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>. we <CONTENT> we was all <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>. it was the most <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i ever see; and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the same.
but as i was <CONTENT>, we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> all the <CONTENT> done now, at last; and we was all <CONTENT> much <CONTENT> out, too, but <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> had <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT> below <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> and get their <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT>, because there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no such <CONTENT>; so he <CONTENT> he would <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and when he <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it give me the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and i see we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>. so <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, now for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>.
"what'<CONTENT> them?" i <CONTENT>.
"<CONTENT> to the <CONTENT> that something is up. sometimes it'<CONTENT> done one <CONTENT>, sometimes another. but there'<CONTENT> always <CONTENT> <CONTENT> around that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>. when <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> out of the <CONTENT>, a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> done it. it'<CONTENT> a very <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and so is the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them both. and it'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> with him, and she <CONTENT> in, and he <CONTENT> out in her <CONTENT>. we'<CONTENT> do that, too."
"but <CONTENT> here, <CONTENT>, what do we <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for that something'<CONTENT> up? <CONTENT> them find it out for themselves--it'<CONTENT> their <CONTENT>."
"<CONTENT>, i <CONTENT>; but you can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> on them. it'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT> they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> from the very <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> us to do everything. they're so <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> take <CONTENT> of nothing at all. so if we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> give them <CONTENT> there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be nobody nor nothing to <CONTENT> with us, and so after all our <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> this <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> go off <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> amount to nothing--<CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be nothing to it."
"well, as for me, <CONTENT>, that'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT> i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
"<CONTENT>!" he <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. so i <CONTENT>:
"but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> no <CONTENT>. any <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> you <CONTENT> me. what you <CONTENT> to do about the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>?"
"you'<CONTENT> be her. you <CONTENT> in, in the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
"why, <CONTENT>, that'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> next <CONTENT>; because, of <CONTENT>, she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> any but that one."
"i <CONTENT>; but you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> it but fifteen <CONTENT>, to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it under the front <CONTENT>."
"all <CONTENT>, then, i'<CONTENT> do it; but i could <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> as <CONTENT> in my own <CONTENT>."
"you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> then, would you?"
"no, but there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be nobody to see what i <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, anyway."
"that <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> nothing to do with it. the <CONTENT> for us to do is <CONTENT> to do our <CONTENT>, and not <CONTENT> about whether <CONTENT> <CONTENT> us do it or not. <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> at all?"
"all <CONTENT>, i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> nothing; i'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>. who'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>?"
"i'<CONTENT> his <CONTENT>. i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> from <CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
"well, then, you'<CONTENT> have to <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> when me and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
"not much. i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> full of <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it on his <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> in <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> take the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> off of me and <CONTENT> it, and we'<CONTENT> all <CONTENT> together. when a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> an <CONTENT>. it'<CONTENT> always <CONTENT> so when a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>. and the same with a <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> whether he'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> one or an <CONTENT> one."
so <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>, and put it on, and <CONTENT> it under the front <CONTENT>, the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> me to. it <CONTENT>:
<CONTENT>. <CONTENT> is <CONTENT>. keep a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> <CONTENT>.
next <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, which <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in <CONTENT>, of a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> on the front <CONTENT>; and next <CONTENT> another one of a <CONTENT> on the back <CONTENT>. i never see a <CONTENT> in such a <CONTENT>. they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a been <CONTENT> <CONTENT> if the <CONTENT> had a been full of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for them behind everything and under the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> through the <CONTENT>. if a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> "<CONTENT>!" if anything <CONTENT>, she <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> "<CONTENT>!" if you <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> her, when she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, she done the same; she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and be <CONTENT>, because she <CONTENT> there was something behind her every <CONTENT>--so she was always a-<CONTENT> around <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> "<CONTENT>," and before she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> two-<CONTENT> around she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> back again, and <CONTENT> it again; and she was <CONTENT> to go to <CONTENT>, but she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> up. so the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> very well, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; he <CONTENT> he never see a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> more <CONTENT>. he <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> it was done <CONTENT>.
so he <CONTENT>, now for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>! so the very next <CONTENT> at the <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> another <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and was <CONTENT> what we <CONTENT> do with it, because we <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> at <CONTENT> they was <CONTENT> to have a <CONTENT> on <CONTENT> at both <CONTENT> all <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> to <CONTENT> around; and the <CONTENT> at the back <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>, and he <CONTENT> it in the back of his <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> back. this <CONTENT> <CONTENT>:
<CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> me, i <CONTENT> to be your <CONTENT>. there is a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> from over in the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> your <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to-<CONTENT>, and they have been <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> you so as you will <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> and not <CONTENT> them. i am one of the <CONTENT>, but have <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> it and <CONTENT> an <CONTENT> <CONTENT> again, and will <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. they will <CONTENT> down from <CONTENT>, along the <CONTENT>, at <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, with a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and go in the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to get him. i am to be off a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> if i see any <CONTENT>; but <CONTENT> of that i will <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> as they get in and not <CONTENT> at all; then <CONTENT> they are <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, you <CONTENT> there and <CONTENT> them in, and can <CONTENT> them at your <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> do anything but <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> i am <CONTENT> you, if you do they will <CONTENT> something and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>. i do not <CONTENT> any <CONTENT> but to <CONTENT> i have done the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>.
<CONTENT> <CONTENT>
we was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> after <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> over the <CONTENT> a-<CONTENT>, with a <CONTENT>, and had a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> at the <CONTENT> and found her all <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and found them in such a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> which <CONTENT> they was <CONTENT> on, and made us go <CONTENT> off to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> we was done <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> us what the <CONTENT> was, and never <CONTENT> on a <CONTENT> about the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to, because we <CONTENT> as much about it as <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and as <CONTENT> as we was <CONTENT> up <CONTENT> and her back was <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> up a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it up to our <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up about <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> eleven, and <CONTENT> put on <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> that he <CONTENT> and was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> with the <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>:
"where'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>?"
"i <CONTENT> out a <CONTENT> of it," i <CONTENT>, "on a <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>."
"well, you <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> out, then--it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> here."
"we can get along without it," i <CONTENT>.
"we can get along with it, too," he <CONTENT>; "<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> down <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> it. and then <CONTENT> <CONTENT> down the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> and <CONTENT> along. i'<CONTENT> go and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> into <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> in <CONTENT>, and be <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> as you get there."
so out he <CONTENT>, and down <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i. the <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> as a <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, was where i had <CONTENT> it, so i <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> with it on, and <CONTENT> out my <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up <CONTENT> very <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> up to the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> all <CONTENT>, but here <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> with a <CONTENT>, and i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> in my <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> on my <CONTENT>, and the next <CONTENT> she see me; and she <CONTENT>:
"you been down <CONTENT>?"
"<CONTENT>'<CONTENT>."
"what you been <CONTENT> down there?"

"<CONTENT>'<CONTENT>!"
"no'<CONTENT>."
"well, then, what <CONTENT> you to go down there this <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>?"
"i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> '<CONTENT>."
"you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>? <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> me that <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>, i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> what you been <CONTENT> down there."
"i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> been <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, i <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> if i have."
i <CONTENT> she'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> me go now, and as a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she would; but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> there was so many <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on she was <CONTENT> in a <CONTENT> about every <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so she <CONTENT>, very <CONTENT>:
"you <CONTENT> <CONTENT> into that <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> and <CONTENT> there <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>. you been up to something you no <CONTENT> to, and i <CONTENT> i'<CONTENT> find out what it is before i'<CONTENT> done with you."
so she <CONTENT> <CONTENT> as i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> into the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>. my, but there was a <CONTENT> there! fifteen <CONTENT>, and every one of them had a <CONTENT>. i was most <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> to a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> down. they was <CONTENT> around, some of them <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and all of them <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>; but i <CONTENT> they was, because they was always <CONTENT> off their <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> them on, and <CONTENT> their <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> their <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> with their <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> myself, but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> take my <CONTENT> off, all the same.
i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> would <CONTENT>, and get done with me, and <CONTENT> me, if she <CONTENT> to, and <CONTENT> me get <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> how we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> this <CONTENT>, and what a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>-<CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> ourselves into, so we could <CONTENT> <CONTENT> around <CONTENT> off, and <CONTENT> out with <CONTENT> before these <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out of <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for us.
at last she <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> me <CONTENT>, but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> them <CONTENT>, i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> which <CONTENT> of me was up; because these <CONTENT> was in such a <CONTENT> now that some was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> now and <CONTENT> for them <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> but a few <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>; and others was <CONTENT> to get them to <CONTENT> on and <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>; and here was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> at the <CONTENT>, and me a-<CONTENT> all over and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> down in my <CONTENT> i was that <CONTENT>; and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> down my <CONTENT> and behind my <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, when one of them <CONTENT>, "i'<CONTENT> for <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> first and <CONTENT> now, and <CONTENT> them when they <CONTENT>," i most <CONTENT>; and a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> down my <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> she see it, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> as a <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>:
"for the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, what is the <CONTENT> with the <CONTENT>? he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as you're <CONTENT>, and they're <CONTENT> out!"
and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to see, and she <CONTENT> off my <CONTENT>, and out <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and what was <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>, and she <CONTENT> me, and <CONTENT> me, and <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT>, what a <CONTENT> you <CONTENT> give me! and how <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> i am it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT>; for <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> against us, and it never <CONTENT> but it <CONTENT>, and when i see that <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you, for i <CONTENT> by the <CONTENT> and all it was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> your <CONTENT> would be if--<CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> me that was what you'<CONTENT> been down there for, i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>. now <CONTENT> out to <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> see no more of you <CONTENT> <CONTENT>!"
i was up <CONTENT> in a <CONTENT>, and down the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> in another one, and <CONTENT> through the <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>-to. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> get my <CONTENT> out, i was so <CONTENT>; but i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as i could we must <CONTENT> for it now, and not a <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>--the <CONTENT> full of <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, with <CONTENT>!
his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and he <CONTENT>:
"no!--is that so? <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> it <CONTENT>! why, <CONTENT>, if it was to do over again, i <CONTENT> i could <CONTENT> two hundred! if we could put it off <CONTENT>--"
"<CONTENT>! <CONTENT>!" i <CONTENT>. "where'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>?"
"<CONTENT> at your <CONTENT>; if you <CONTENT> out your <CONTENT> you can <CONTENT> him. he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and everything'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. now we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> out and give the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>."
but then we <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> with the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>:
"i <CONTENT> you we'<CONTENT> be too <CONTENT>; they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>--the <CONTENT> is <CONTENT>. here, i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> some of you into the <CONTENT>, and you <CONTENT> for '<CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> when they <CONTENT>; and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> around a <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> if you can <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
so in they <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> see us in the <CONTENT>, and most <CONTENT> on us <CONTENT> we was <CONTENT> to get under the <CONTENT>. but we <CONTENT> under all <CONTENT>, and out through the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> but <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> first, me next, and <CONTENT> last, which was <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. now we was in the <CONTENT>-to, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> by <CONTENT>. so we <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> us there and put his <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> out nothing, it was so <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> he would <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT> to get further, and when he <CONTENT> us <CONTENT> must <CONTENT> out first, and him last. so he <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>, and the <CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> around out there all the <CONTENT>; and at last he <CONTENT> us, and we <CONTENT> out, and <CONTENT> down, not <CONTENT>, and not <CONTENT> the least <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> towards the <CONTENT> in <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> to it all <CONTENT>, and me and <CONTENT> over it; but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on a <CONTENT> on the top <CONTENT>, and then he <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, so he had to <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, which <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and made a <CONTENT>; and as he <CONTENT> in our <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> out:
"who'<CONTENT> that? <CONTENT>, or i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>!"
but we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> our <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>. then there was a <CONTENT>, and a <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>! and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> around us! we <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> out:
"here they are! they'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>! after '<CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>!"
so here they <CONTENT>, full <CONTENT>. we could <CONTENT> them because they <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, but we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. we was in the <CONTENT> to the mill; and when they <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on to us we <CONTENT> into the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> them go by, and then <CONTENT> in behind them. they'<CONTENT> had all the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up, so they <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> off the <CONTENT>; but by this <CONTENT> <CONTENT> had <CONTENT> them <CONTENT>, and here they <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> enough for a <CONTENT>; but they was our <CONTENT>; so we <CONTENT> in our <CONTENT> <CONTENT> they <CONTENT> up; and when they see it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> nobody but us, and no <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> them, they only <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> towards the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>; and then we up-<CONTENT> again, and <CONTENT> along after them <CONTENT> we was <CONTENT> to the mill, and then <CONTENT> up through the <CONTENT> to where my <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> in and <CONTENT> for <CONTENT> <CONTENT> towards the <CONTENT> of the <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> no more <CONTENT> than we was <CONTENT> to. then we <CONTENT> out, <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, for the <CONTENT> where my <CONTENT> was; and we could <CONTENT> them <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> at each other all up and down the <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> we was so <CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> out. and when we <CONTENT> onto the <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>:
"now, <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, you're a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> again, and i <CONTENT> you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> ever be a <CONTENT> no more."
"<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>, too, <CONTENT>. it '<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> it '<CONTENT> done <CONTENT>; <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> nobody <CONTENT> <CONTENT> up a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>' <CONTENT>-up <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> what <CONTENT> one <CONTENT>."
we was all <CONTENT> as we could be, but <CONTENT> was the <CONTENT> of all because he had a <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> of his <CONTENT>.
when me and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> that we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> so <CONTENT> as what we <CONTENT> before. it was <CONTENT> him <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>; so we <CONTENT> him in the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> up one of the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> for to <CONTENT> him, but he <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>; i can do it myself. <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> now; <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> around here, and the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> along so <CONTENT>; <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> her <CONTENT>! <CONTENT>, we done it <CONTENT>!--'<CONTENT> we <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> we'<CONTENT> a had the <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT>., there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a been no '<CONTENT> of <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>!' <CONTENT> down in his <CONTENT>; no, <CONTENT>, we'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> him over the <CONTENT>--that'<CONTENT> what we'<CONTENT> a done with him--and done it <CONTENT> as <CONTENT> as nothing at all, too. <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>--<CONTENT> the <CONTENT>!"
but me and <CONTENT> was <CONTENT>--and <CONTENT>. and after we'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, i <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT> it, <CONTENT>."
so he <CONTENT>:
"well, <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> is de <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> to me, <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> <CONTENT>' <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> one <CONTENT> de <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, would he <CONTENT>, 'go on <CONTENT> <CONTENT> me, <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> a <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> one?' is <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>? would he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>? you <CONTENT> he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>! well, <CONTENT>, is <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> it? no, <CONTENT>--i <CONTENT>' <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> out'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> '<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>; not if it'<CONTENT> forty <CONTENT>!"
i <CONTENT> he was <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and i <CONTENT> he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> what he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--so it was all <CONTENT> now, and i <CONTENT> <CONTENT> i was a-<CONTENT> for a <CONTENT>. he <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> about it, but me and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> to it and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so he was for <CONTENT> out and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> himself; but we <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> him. then he give us a <CONTENT> of his <CONTENT>, but it <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> do no <CONTENT>.
so when he <CONTENT> me <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, he <CONTENT>:
"well, then, if you're <CONTENT> to go, i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> you the <CONTENT> to do when you get to the <CONTENT>. <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> to be <CONTENT> as the <CONTENT>, and put a <CONTENT> full of <CONTENT> in his <CONTENT>, and then take and <CONTENT> him all around the back <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> him here in the <CONTENT>, in a <CONTENT> <CONTENT> amongst the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> him and take his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> from him, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> give it back to him <CONTENT> you get him back to the <CONTENT>, or else he will <CONTENT> this <CONTENT> so he can find it again. it'<CONTENT> the <CONTENT> they all do."
so i <CONTENT> i would, and <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> was to <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> when he see the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he was <CONTENT> again.
the <CONTENT> was an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; a very <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> when i <CONTENT> him up. i <CONTENT> him me and my <CONTENT> was over on <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> on a <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT> we found, and about <CONTENT> he must a <CONTENT> his <CONTENT> in his <CONTENT>, for it <CONTENT> off and <CONTENT> him in the <CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT> him to go over there and <CONTENT> it and not <CONTENT> nothing about it, nor <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, because we <CONTENT> to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> this <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>.
"who is your <CONTENT>?" he <CONTENT>.
"the <CONTENT>, down <CONTENT>."
"<CONTENT>," he <CONTENT>. and after a <CONTENT>, he <CONTENT>:
"how'<CONTENT> you <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> <CONTENT>?"
"he had a <CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>, "and it <CONTENT> him."
"<CONTENT> <CONTENT>," he <CONTENT>.
so he <CONTENT> up his <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> his <CONTENT>-<CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT>. but when he <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> of her--<CONTENT> she was <CONTENT> enough for one, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for two. i <CONTENT>:
"<CONTENT>, you <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> be <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, she <CONTENT> the three of us <CONTENT> enough."
"what three?"
"why, me and <CONTENT>, and--and--and the <CONTENT>; that'<CONTENT> what i <CONTENT>."
"<CONTENT>," he <CONTENT>.
but he put his <CONTENT> on the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> her, and <CONTENT> his <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> around for a <CONTENT> one. but they was all <CONTENT> and <CONTENT>; so he <CONTENT> my <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> for me to <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> back, or i could <CONTENT> around further, or <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> go down <CONTENT> and get them <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT> if i <CONTENT> to. but i <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>; so i <CONTENT> him <CONTENT> how to find the <CONTENT>, and then he <CONTENT>.
i <CONTENT> an <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> to myself, <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> he can'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in three <CONTENT> of a <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, as the <CONTENT> is? <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> it <CONTENT> him three or four <CONTENT>? what are we <CONTENT> to do?--<CONTENT> around there <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> out of the <CONTENT>? no, <CONTENT>; i <CONTENT> what i'<CONTENT> do. i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and when he <CONTENT> back if he <CONTENT> he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> to go any more i'<CONTENT> get down there, too, if i <CONTENT>; and we'<CONTENT> take and <CONTENT> him, and keep him, and <CONTENT> out down the <CONTENT>; and when <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> done with him we'<CONTENT> give him what it'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, or all we <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> him get <CONTENT>.
so then i <CONTENT> into a <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> to get some <CONTENT>; and next <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> was <CONTENT> up over my <CONTENT>! i <CONTENT> out and <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>, but they <CONTENT> me he'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> in the <CONTENT> some <CONTENT> or other, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> back yet. well, <CONTENT> i, that <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>, and i'<CONTENT> <CONTENT> out for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> off. so <CONTENT> i <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> my <CONTENT> into <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>! he <CONTENT>:
"why, <CONTENT>! where you been all this <CONTENT>, you <CONTENT>?"
"i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> been <CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>, "only <CONTENT> <CONTENT> for the <CONTENT> <CONTENT>--me and <CONTENT>."
"why, where ever <CONTENT> you go?" he <CONTENT>. "your <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> been <CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
"she <CONTENT>'<CONTENT>," i <CONTENT>, "because we was all <CONTENT>. we <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> and the <CONTENT>, but they <CONTENT> us, and we <CONTENT> them; but we <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> them on the <CONTENT>, so we <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> out after them and <CONTENT> over, but <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> find nothing of them; so we <CONTENT> along up-<CONTENT> <CONTENT> we <CONTENT> <CONTENT> of <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> out; and <CONTENT> up the <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> to <CONTENT>, and never <CONTENT> up <CONTENT> about an <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; then we <CONTENT> over here to <CONTENT> the <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> at the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> to see what he can <CONTENT>, and i'<CONTENT> a-<CONTENT> out to get something to <CONTENT> for us, and then we're <CONTENT> <CONTENT>."
so then we <CONTENT> to the <CONTENT>-<CONTENT> to get "<CONTENT>"; but <CONTENT> as i <CONTENT>, he <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> there; so the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> he <CONTENT> a <CONTENT> out of the <CONTENT>, and we <CONTENT> a while <CONTENT>, but <CONTENT> <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>; so the <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, <CONTENT> along, <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> it <CONTENT>, or <CONTENT> it, when he <CONTENT> done <CONTENT> around--but we would <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> get him to <CONTENT> me <CONTENT> and <CONTENT> for <CONTENT>; and he <CONTENT> there <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> no <CONTENT> in it, and i must <CONTENT> along, and <CONTENT> <CONTENT> <CONTENT> see we was all <CONTENT>.

<CONTENT> <CONTENT> i <CONTENT> to go <CONTENT> enough to see about <CONTENT>, and was all <CONTENT> to go; but after that i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> a <CONTENT>, not for <CONTENT>.

so he <CONTENT> his <CONTENT>, and then <CONTENT> off <CONTENT> where he had <CONTENT> it down, and <CONTENT> it, and give it to her. she <CONTENT>:
"why, it'<CONTENT> from <CONTENT>. <CONTENT>--it'<CONTENT> from <CONTENT>."
i <CONTENT> another <CONTENT> would do me <CONTENT>; but i <CONTENT>'<CONTENT> <CONTENT>. but before she could <CONTENT> it <CONTENT> she <CONTENT> it and <CONTENT>--for she see something. and so <CONTENT> i. it was <CONTENT> <CONTENT> on a <CONTENT>; and that <CONTENT> <CONTENT>; and <CONTENT>, in her <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, with his <CONTENT> <CONTENT> behind him; and a <CONTENT> of <CONTENT>. i <CONTENT> the <CONTENT> behind the first <CONTENT> that <CONTENT> <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>. she <CONTENT> herself at <CONTENT>, <CONTENT>, and <CONTENT>:
